## HypnoS Overview


HypnoS is a free and strong UCI chess engine derived from Stockfish 
that analyzes chess positions and computes the optimal moves.

HypnoS does not include a graphical user interface (GUI) that is required 
to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. These GUIs are 
developed independently from HypnoS and are available online.

HypnoS development is currently supported on the Openbench framework. OpenBench (created by Andrew Grant) is an open-source Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) framework designed for self-play testing of engines. OpenBench makes use of distributed computing, allowing anyone to contribute CPU time to further the development of some of the world's most powerful engines.

A big thank you goes to the guys at http://chess.grantnet.us/ especially to Andrew Grant for running and improving this testing framework
